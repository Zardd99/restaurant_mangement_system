# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) — Access Graph

This is the canonical reference for **who can do what** in the Restaurant Management System.

- **Source of truth (enforcement):** [`backend_restaurant/config/rbac.ts`](https://github.com/Zardd99/backend_restaurant/blob/main/config/rbac.ts) + the `requirePermission(...)` middleware in [`backend_restaurant/middleware/auth.ts`](https://github.com/Zardd99/backend_restaurant/blob/main/middleware/auth.ts).
- **UI mirror (gating only):** [`restaurant_mangement_system/app/config/rbac.ts`](../app/config/rbac.ts).
- The frontend matrix is for hiding controls/routes a role can't use. **All real authorization happens on the backend.** Keep the two matrices in sync.

## Roles

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `admin` | Full system access, including staff/user administration. |
| `manager` | All operational areas (menu, inventory, suppliers, orders, billing, promotions, tables) except user administration. |
| `chef` | Kitchen: read menu/inventory, read orders, advance order/prep status. |
| `waiter` | Floor: create/update orders, manage tables, take payment, read menu/receipts. |
| `cashier` | Till: read orders, take payment, read receipts. |
| `customer` | Public: browse menu, place own orders, leave reviews. |

> Note: `inventory:read`/`inventory:write` endpoints that participate in the order lifecycle (`/check-availability`, `/preview`, `/consume`) also accept order-managing roles (waiter/chef) so service flows aren't blocked — see route table.

## Frontend gating

- The entire `(admin)` route group is wrapped by [`app/(admin)/layout.tsx`](../app/(admin)/layout.tsx) → `ProtectedRoute requiredRoles={["admin","manager"]}`.
- `ProtectedRoute` supports `requiredRole` (legacy), `requiredRoles`, and `requiredPermission`.
- Unauthenticated users are sent to `/login`; authenticated-but-unauthorized users to `/unauthorized`.

## Changing the matrix

1. Edit `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` in **both** `rbac.ts` files (backend = enforcement, frontend = UI).
2. Update this document's matrix + route tables.
3. Re-run `npm run build` (backend) and `npx tsc --noEmit` (frontend).
